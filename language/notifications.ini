It is encouraged to use different coding for these answers (in general other=99 and unknown=98). There are two reasons for this: <p>1. You can easily add additional choices without needing to recode your values; and 2. when you are using statistical software it is apparent which values correspond to special codes. For example, the following is NOT recommended: </p><small><ul class="list-group" style=" padding-left: 50px; width: 215px; "><li class="list-group-item">1, Dr. Jones</li><li class="list-group-item">2, Dr. Parker </li><li class="list-group-item">3, Dr. Smith</li><li class="list-group-item">4, Other </li></ul></small><p>Say you have collected data for 100 records and you now want to add Dr. Rose to the list. A common mistake is the following: </p><small><ul class="list-group" style=" padding-left: 50px; width: 215px; "><li class="list-group-item">1, Dr. Jones</li><li class="list-group-item">2, Dr. Parker </li><li class="list-group-item">3, Dr. Smith</li><li class="list-group-item">4, Dr. Rose <br><strong>(DON\"T DO IT THIS WAY)</strong></li><li class="list-group-item">5, Other</li></ul></small><p>If, before the change, you had 20 records as \"other\with a value of 4, they would all instantly be transferred to Dr. Rose. This usually isn\"t what is intended. A better design is something like: </p><small><ul class="list-group" style=" padding-left: 50px; padding-top: 0px; width: 215px; "><li class="list-group-item">1, Dr. Jones</li><li class="list-group-item">2, Dr. Parker </li><li class="list-group-item">3, Dr. Smith</li><li class="list-group-item">99, Other</li></ul></small><p>Now you can add additional members to the list during the project without needing to recode. And, when you analyze your data the other value is easily identified.</p></div>'
